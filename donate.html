    <h2>DONATE FOOD</h2>
    <div id="donate-banner"></div>
    <section id="donate">
        <p>Anyone is welcome to donate food and we appreciate donations of fresh food and cooked/prepared food from supermarkets, restaurants, offices or other locations, which then the people using the space around Folketshus and anyone who passes by can benefit from.</p>
        <p>Though there are many programs in the city now catering to fighting food waste, lots of food  slips through the cracks of the cracks in the system. The Free Fridge Copenhagen aims to fill these gaps and to provide the tools for this food to also be saved and redistributed without conditions or having to meet set timetables.</p>
        <p>The location of the fridge also enables it to help those most in need by being located in the centre of the city and accessible 24/7. There are many people who suffer from food insecurity but for various reasons are unwilling or unable to receive it from other sources. The Free Fridge addresses this by allowing complete anonymity.</p>
